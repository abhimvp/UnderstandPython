# About Python Typing - Type hints & Annotations

- Learning the typing module in Python like type hints and annotations.
  - The typing module allows you to add types to a bunch of different things like `variables` and `parameters` to your `return values` from functions
  - This can help with better documentation making it easier for others to read the code and can see what types are expected of certain parameters , Method calls..etc
- [Official Documentation for typing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) - it's a built in module - no need to install it
- All this module is doing is documenting your code , doesn't change the functionality to your python code - only adds types to your method params and to it's return types etc
