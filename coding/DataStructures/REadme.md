# Data Structures in Python

- Learning from scratch instead of using libraries for future reference and to have fundemental understanding

## Linked List & Doubly Linked List

- Implement bunch of different operations
  - Traverse the LL
  - Display the LL
  - See if it contains some values
  - Calculate the length , Get the lenght
  - Append , Prepend
  - Insert at a specific position
  - Delete , Pop a specific index
  - remove a element not by value but by position

```

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
