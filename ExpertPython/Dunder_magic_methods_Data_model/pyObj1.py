x = [1, 2, 3]

# we know that we can add two lists
print(x + y)

# $ python pyObj1.py
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(type(x))  # this x here is a object as it's a part of class list
# $ python pyObj1.py
# <class 'list'>

# here the x and y are python objects and with the objects we can perform many things with them
print(x * 3)  # we can multiply the list with integer ,
# here the operator tells the python object what it needs to do and
# likewise many operations and modifiction can be performed with python objects and
# something is happening behind the scenes
