- In this , we will see expert level python features , how they work , how they implement , how we use them in python code
- How python code is actually ran and executed - python is interpreted programming language , althrough it's interprested , it's also compiled and turns it into a byte code
- compiler -> turns high level code to low level code(Byte code) understood by machine
- Interpreter -> takes some kind of code typically byte code , interprets and runs that code , translate it on the fly into machine code that is executed by our computer
