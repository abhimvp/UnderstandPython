# Python Introduction

- Python usually uses an Interpreter. An Interpreter is like a translator , goes line by line through our code & executes the line before going to next line.
- we download python from [pythonSoftwareFoundation](https://www.python.org/) for us to translate the python human readable code into bytecode which is understood by machines/OS.
- python is written in C Programming language : [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)
- Python is usually slower than C , C++, Java , trade off is you don't want to write python code for low-level systems and hardware interactions.
