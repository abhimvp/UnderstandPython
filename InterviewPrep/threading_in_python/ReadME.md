# Threading in python & learn about what GIL is & what it is doing:

```bash
python main.py
Main: Starting threads...
Thread A: Starting to count.
Thread B: Starting to count.
Main: Waiting for threads to finish...
Thread A: Finished counting to 25000000.
Thread B: Finished counting to 25000000.
Main: All threads finished.
Total execution time: 1.2660 seconds
```

- **The Lock:** Only one thread at a time within this process can hold the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**. Holding the GIL is necessary to safely **execute** most Python bytecode.
- `join()`: The main thread hits thread1.join() and waits until Thread-A finishes. Then it hits thread2.join() and waits for Thread-B to finish.

- The `Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)` is a **mutex** (a type of lock) used in the **standard CPython interpreter**.

  - It **prevents** multiple threads within the same process from **executing** Python **bytecode** simultaneously (at the exact same micro-instant).
  - It **simplifies** CPython's internal memory management. By **ensuring only one thread runs Python code at a time**, it makes managing things like object reference counts much easier and protects against certain types of data corruption without needing complex locking on every single object. This also made it easier to integrate C libraries that weren't originally designed for threading.
  - It **limits** the ability of multi-threaded CPython programs to take **full advantage of multi-core processors** for CPU-bound tasks.

- Do Other Languages Have a GIL?
  - No, many popular languages do not have a GIL, which is why they are often cited as having better multi-threading performance for CPU-bound work out-of-the-box:
    - **Java**: No GIL. Designed for multi-threading; uses more fine-grained locking mechanisms.
    - **C++**: No GIL. Requires manual memory management and explicit locking by the programmer.
    - **Go**: No GIL. Uses lightweight "goroutines" mapped onto OS threads, designed for concurrency.
    - **Rust**: No GIL. Its strict compile-time ownership and borrowing rules prevent many data races, reducing the need for a global lock.
    - **C# (.NET)**: No GIL. Similar to Java, relies on the underlying runtime's threading model.

Single, Simple API Call: If your Python code just needs to make one API call, wait for the response, and then process it, then yes, you are absolutely correct. You generally wouldn't use threading or multiprocessing for that. You'd just make the call directly using a library like requests.

Multiple API Calls (Sequentially): If you need to make several API calls one after the other (call API A, get result, then call API B, get result, etc.), you also typically wouldn't use threading or multiprocessing. You'd just make the calls in sequence.

Multiple API Calls (Concurrently): This is where it changes. If you need to make multiple independent API calls and you want your program to run faster by making them happen at the same time instead of one by one, then you DO often use concurrency modules.

threading: Because API calls are I/O-bound (most of the time is spent waiting for the network and the remote server), threading works very well here. While one thread is waiting for API call A to respond, another thread can start making API call B. The GIL doesn't hinder this because the threads release the GIL while waiting for I/O. This can drastically reduce the total time spent.

**asyncio** (and libraries like aiohttp, httpx): This is the modern and often preferred way in Python to handle many concurrent I/O operations like API calls. Using async and await, you can manage many non-blocking calls efficiently within a single thread, often using fewer resources than creating many threads.

multiprocessing: You would still generally not use multiprocessing for API calls. The overhead of creating separate processes is usually unnecessary and counterproductive for I/O-bound tasks like this.

- The GIL regulates concurrency within a single CPython process, ensuring only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. It doesn't directly control or block other independent processes running on your system.

- The standard CPython interpreter you install comes with the GIL mechanism built into its code.
- When you run `python main.py`, the OS creates a **Process**. The Python interpreter runs inside this process. The `GIL` mechanism **exists within this running interpreter instance**. The main Thread (which starts automatically in the process) **acquires** (or "picks up") the GIL, which then allows that thread to execute Python bytecode.
- the thread releases the GIL periodically (after a short time slice or number of instructions) OR when it performs a blocking I/O operation (like input(), network calls, time.sleep()). `It does not typically hold` the GIL until its entire task is finished.
- Once the GIL is released by one thread, another thread within the same process that is ready to run Python bytecode can acquire the GIL.
- Each CPython Process running on your OS has its own, independent GIL.
- If you open two separate terminal windows and run python main.py in each, you have two Processes. Each of those processes has its own GIL that only affects the threads inside that specific process.
- The GIL in Process A does not interfere with the GIL or threads in Process B. They are completely separate locks in separate containers.The GIL in Process A does not interfere with the GIL or threads in Process B. They are completely separate locks in separate containers.
- **So, the corrected understanding is:** When you run a Python script, the OS creates a Process. Inside that process, the Python interpreter manages threads using a per-process GIL. A thread acquires this GIL to run Python bytecode and releases it periodically or on I/O waits, allowing other threads within that same process to acquire it and run. Other separate Python processes have their own independent GILs and run completely unaffected by the GIL in the first process. This is precisely why the multiprocessing module works to achieve parallelism â€“ it creates separate processes, each getting its own GIL.
