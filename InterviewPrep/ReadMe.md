# Python Interview Prep Guide

Reference : [TechWithTim](https://youtu.be/BeqlRl5dV_8?si=fFeI1FyVKeYrMJnZ)

- Overview:

  - we could have a `knowledge based interview`, where you're just articulating your thoughts, answering questions or you could have a hands on `coding interview`.
  - let's look into `knowledge based components` & `coding components`.

- Most common Mistakes that python devs make in interviews:

  - Inexperience in python coding - not being fluent in writing the language.
  - Unaware of low level implementation of high level features.
  - Inability to communicate your thought process.
  - Lacking core python understanding.

- you may get asked on:

  - Knowledge based questions:
    - what is GIL in python?
  - Hands on Coding:
    - they give you some type of problem usually a leetcode style problem & solve it on whiteboard or using your computer or a shared IDE.

- Knowledge Based Interviews:

  - there are few categories of questions that you're likely going to get asked. You should be familiar with following list of things & start preparing answers for , so that you're confident in interviews.
    - Main thing is you answer confidently.
      - Always be upfront and honest.
      - If you don't know the answer, that's okay.
        - you can say that truthfully.
      - if you do know what the answer is..
        - answer it like you know it.
        - don't be kind of scared or nervous.
    - Core Python concepts:
      - if statements
      - loops
      - while loops
      - functions
      - All of those syntax pieces you should know and very likely you should have memorized.And you'll anyways if you write a lot of python code.
    - Data types:
      - when to use a tuple?
      - when to use a list?
      - when to use something like a set/dictionary?
        - named tuple?
        - default dictionary?
    - Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
      - how do you create a class?
      - what are things like dunder methods? ( fundamental to python language and understand them deeply)
    - File Handling:
      - how do you open files?
      - how do you work with JSON files?
    - Error Handling?
      - try accept block in python (we don't have try catch)
      - finally statement?
        - do you understand kind of how that works and how to handle specific exceptions?
    - Memory management:
      - a little bit lower level( but definitely something to brush up on)
    - Language Paradigm:
      - what type of language is python?(Python is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language) - you should be knowing what that means and the paradigm or the style of writing code in python compared to writing something like Go or Rust or Java.
    - Concurrency & parallelism:
      - what is threading?
      - what is multiprocessing?
      - what is asynchronous programming in python?
    - Niche Features:
      - you want to know what makes python specific and unique and those different features that pop up a lot in python but not in see in other languages:
        - Decorators.
        - Generators.
        - Context managers.
        - List comprehensions.
    - Knowledge of libraries and frameworks:
      - if you're going for a Django interview, you'll probably get asked a lot of questions related to the Django web framework. this will depend on type of role you're applying for.
      - lot of times you'll get mixtures of questions in specific libraries or frameworks.

- How you can effectively answer these questions and prepare well:

  - how would you answer the above kind of questions properly?
    - when you're preparing for your interview that you actually practice like you play.
    - Practice Answering Out Loud.
    - Generate quizzes related to Python using AI.
    - Record yourself and watch it back.
      - see your mannerisms.
      - see if you're stuttering.
      - see if you're using "um" or "ah" a lot.
      - you sound confident.
    - The more you practice speaking out loud like Tim do every day, speaking to a camera, the better you're going to be at communicating, and the more concise your answers are going to be.
    - You got to dail the thought process in.
    - Make use of AI here , whatever role you're interviewing copy the description and ask Gemini to ask you bunch of questions that you may get asked for and answer them out loud.
    - Record yourself and watch it back.

- Hands on coding interview:
  - Technical Interview : it's much more about the way that you communicate, and that you talk with your interviewer than it is necessarily about you getting the correct answer.
    - The reason for companies give these technical interviews to get an inside look at the way that you think and you break down problems, so even if you know the answer immediately the last thing you want to do is : `Go ahead and solve it`(especially if you're solving it silently).
    - show the interviewer your step by step process and that you can think problems critically.
    - you want to pretend like you don't know the answer and think through it & show them that your problem solving in real time to come up with the solution.
