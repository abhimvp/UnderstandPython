In python everything is built by this "class" keyword.
OOP is what we call a paradigm. That is, it's a way for us to think about our code and structure our code in a way that is easier to maintain , extend and write.
We use "class" to create our own data Type
class is basically a blureprint. The blueprint of what we want to create.The basic attributes , the properties our class has , what are basic methods or actions that our class can take
From the above blueprint , we will be able to create diff objects over and over again using the blueprint as building block.
class BigObject: pass #Class
obj1 = BigObject() #We are creating new object by instantiating this class
